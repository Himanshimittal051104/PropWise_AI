## ✨ What this project does

You enter:

- Location
- BHK 
- Bathrooms
- Total Sqft

and PropWise AI instantly predicts the **estimated house price (in Lakhs)** using an ML model served via FastAPI.

## 🚀 Features

- XGBoost-based house price prediction model trained on Bengaluru housing data
- Advanced feature engineering, outlier removal, and log-transformed target optimization
- Location-based one-hot encoding for accurate price modeling
- FastAPI backend serving real-time ML predictions via REST API
- Secure Google Authentication (NextAuth) with protected routes
- User-specific prediction history persisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Interactive dashboard with real-time prediction analytics
- Session-based access control for secure API endpoints
- Loading states, form validation, and improved UX handling
- Full-stack architecture: Notebook → ML Model → API → Database → UI
- Backend deployed on Render, Frontend deployed on Vercel
